Deep Learning for Java
=======================

Deep learning is a form of state-of-the-art machine learning that can learn to recognize patterns in data unsupervised.

Unsupervised pattern recognition saves time during data analysis, trend discovery and labeling of certain types of data, such as image, text, sound and time series.

See [Deeplearning4j.org](http://deeplearning4j.org/) for applications, tutorials, definitions and other resources on the discipline.

Feature set summary
====================

1. Distributed deep learning via Akka clustering and distributed coordination of jobs via Hazelcast with configurations stored in Apache Zookeeper.

2. Various data-preprocessing tools, such as an image loader that allows for binarization, scaling of pixels, normalization via zero-unit mean and standard deviation.

3. Deep-belief networks for both continuous and binary data. Support for sequential via moving window/viterbi

4. Native matrices via Jblas, a Fortran library for matrix computations. As 1.2.4 - GPUs when nvblas is present.

5. Automatic cluster provisioning for Amazon Web Services' Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

6. Baseline ability to read from a variety of input providers including S3 and local file systems.

7. Text processing via Word2Vec as well as a term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TFIDF) vectorizer.
          
  - Special tokenizers/stemmers and a SentenceIterator interface to make handling text input agnostic.
  - Ability to do moving-window operations via a Window encoding. Optimized with Viterbi.
